# Orchard Core 

Azure Blob Storage Unit Test Template

A template for unit testing for beginners. If you find unit testing tedious, or if you are thinking, this is so complex to setup, this template along with the tutorials can help you to start. 

It shows you a common folder layout, and techniques to unit test using xunit.
But the principles should apply to any framework. If you are interested you can add examples using your favorite Framework, so others can learn from it.


### A few recommendations,

- Some beginners start with migrating their Console App test to a unit test. The one you created with all your code testing the different classes.

- Some developers unit test the core functions, with a few tests. And/Or APIs that are frequently changing. As the probability to break is greater than a piece of code that never changes.




## Unit testing advantages:

* Reduces defects or reduces bugs when changing the existing functionality. Noticed the Key word: "Reduces". 
* Reduces Cost of testing as defects are captured in very early stages
* Improves design and allows better code refactoring.
